This question is the same prompt as the first question but instead of an
array of animal objects, you have to query a DOM node, a section with a
class of ‘all-animals’, which contains all animals.

Each animal will be encapsulated in a div with a class of ‘animal’. Inside
this div are three nodes:

- An h2 containing the animal type
- A paragraph containing a child span with a class of ‘mammal-value’ that indicates whether the animal is a mammal

You should find all mammal nodes and append them as children of the
section with a class of ‘only-mammals’.

What Skills Does This Test?

- DOM manipulation
- Iterating through nested DOM elements
